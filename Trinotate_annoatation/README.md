# Annotating unannoatated regions in superTranscriptome

For annotating genes those do not have gene ids or their default gene id for those genes is starts with 'MSTRG', we have used Trinotate and run it as a pipeline with bpipe. The different homology searches such as BLASTX, BLASTP, HMM-scan, SignalP, TMHMM and RNAmmer finished during pipeline run.
