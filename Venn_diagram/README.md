# Locating superTranscripts on 4 different sorghum genomes
The superTranscriptomic approach identified total 45,864 gene families in sweet sorghum population and single reference genome is not enought to cover all these information, beacuse these genes are came from 4-5 different sweet sorghum varieties. We have tried to lacate these superTranscripts 15 diverse sorghum genomes by using PASA gene structure annotation pipeline and reported remarkable PAV.

We further classified aligned SuperTranscripts in to core (present on all 15 genome), shell (present on 2 to 14 genomes) and private (showed presence only specific genome) categories based on their annotation with PASA.

Finally we created flower plot, venn and bar diagram R language to visualize core, shell and private gene famlies.
