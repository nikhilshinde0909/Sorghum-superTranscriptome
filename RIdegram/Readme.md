# Ideogram representing co-expreesed genes as a QTL for internode development

The gene desisties were obtained for ideogarm from GFFEx function of RIdeogarm package from superTranscript annotated Sweet sorghum reference genome with PASA. The ideogram showing gene desities (overlay) and QTL (marker) was constructed with the same.
