# Diffrenial Gene expression comparison

The differential gene expression comparison was done by aligning raw RNA-seq reads to superTranscriptome with HISAT2, followed by read count with featureCounts and later normalization and fold changes with DESeq2. The heatmap and vocano plot also plotted with ggplot2 and EnhacedVolcano R package resepectively.
