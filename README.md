# Sorghum superTranscriptome
The sorghum superTranscriptome, the study aims to identify more number of gene/transcript isoforms as well as nc RNAs in sweet sorghum population by integrating reference guided assembly and de novo transcriptome assembly approach with use of large number of publically availabe RNASeq datasets.

# Modified necklace pipeline
In present study we have made modification in existing necklace pipeline and individually assembled reference guided and de novo transcriptome by using 223  publically available sweet sorghum RNA-seq datasets from sweet sorghum varieties namely Rio, Keller, SIL05, Roma, Della etc. Finally, we integrated above two approachs to construct superTranscripts (clustering with 90% similarity) for sweet sorghum.

# Outcome
We have constructed superTranscriptome for sweet sorghum representing total 45,864 gene families out of which
1. 31,245 having annotations from Sorghum bicolor Rio reference genome
2. 13,815 are unannotated regions of which 2,360 has been annotated with swiss-prot plants db and rest could be the non coding regions
3. 804 are reference genome gaps we have identified from de novo transcriptome assembly, which having annotations from grain sorghum lines BTX623, BTX642 and RTX430
