# Sorghum superTranscriptome
The sorghum superTranscriptome, the study aims to identify more number of gene/transcript isoforms as well as nc RNAs in sweet sorghum population by integrating reference guided assembly and de novo transcriptome assembly approach with use of large number of publically availabe RNASeq datasets.

# Modified necklace pipeline
In present study we have made modification in existing necklace pipeline and individually assembled reference guided and de novo transcriptome by using 108  publically available sweet sorghum RNASeq datasets from sweet sorghum varieties namely Rio, Keller, SIL05, Roma etc. We further integrated these two approach to construct superTranscripts (with 98% similarity) for sweet sorghum population.

# Outcome
We have constructed superTranscriptome for sweet sorghum representing total 44,575 gene families out of which
1. 32,014 having annotations from Sorghum bicolor Rio reference genome
2. 11,613 are unannotated regions of which 2,360 has been annotated with swiss-prot plants db and rest could be the non coding regions
3. 948 are reference genome gaps we have identified from de novo transcriptome assembly, which having annotations from grain sorghum lines BTX623, BTX642 and RTX430
